# Assignment 3 - Sudoku & Database GUI

This assignment consists of two independent Java applications
focusing on algorithmic problem-solving and practical GUI/database integration.

## Sudoku Solver

* Constraint validation for rows, columns and sub-grids
* Emphasis on correctness, efficiency and clean recursion design

## Database GUI Application
* Desktop GUI application for browsing and querying a sample database
* Supports **search, filtering and dynamic data display**
